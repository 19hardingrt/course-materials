My implementation of the BHG Scanner goes through and scans all ports from 1-1024, and outputs the status of all ports (open or closed).


Modifications(Based on to-do's):
  Added Usage Description
  Changed net.Dial to net.DialTimeout
  Added a closedports variable to store number of ports that are closed
  Enhanced the output for easier consumption by adding a comma after %d
  Modified the output to return both the number of open ports and closed ports
  
Modifications based on part 5:
  Created a totalPorts int parameter and set it equal to 1024 within the PortScanner function
  Went to everywhere that called the PortScanner function and updated the parameter
  Changed the PortScanner call in main.go to have 1024 as the parameter since that was the only way it would work.
